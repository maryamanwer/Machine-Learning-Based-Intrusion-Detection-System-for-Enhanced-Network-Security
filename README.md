# Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (ML-IDS)

This project implements a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to enhance network security in enterprise environments. The system uses multiple supervised learning algorithms and is trained on the **TII-SSRC-23** dataset. The goal is to accurately detect malicious activities, including DoS and botnet attacks, with minimal false positives.

## üìë Overview

Traditional IDS often fail to detect zero-day and sophisticated attacks due to their static and signature-based nature. This project leverages supervised machine learning models ‚Äî such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression ‚Äî to develop a dynamic and adaptive IDS capable of identifying both known and unknown threats.

## üß† Best Performing Models

| Model             | Accuracy | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Gradient Boosting (Tuned) | 98.15%   | 95.59%   | 97.80%   |
| Random Forest (Tuned)     | 98.10%   | 95.56%   | **99.70%**   |

- **Gradient Boosting**: Slightly better overall classification
- **Random Forest**: Better in ROC AUC, useful for threshold-based alerts
